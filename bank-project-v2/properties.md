# Get Configuration Properties in Spring 🌱

Hey there, fellow developer! 👋 If you're using Spring Boot, you've probably wondered how to get configuration properties in your application. Well, you're in luck! 🍀 This guide will walk you through the different ways to do just that. Let's dive in! 🏊‍♀️

## The Contenders 🥊

We have three main ways to get configuration properties in Spring:

1. `@Value`
2. `Environment`
3. `@ConfigurationProperties`

Let's take a closer look at each one. 🧐

### @Value 🏷️

`@Value` is a Spring annotation which you can use to inject values directly.

```java
@Value("${property.name}")
private String propertyName;
```

### Environment 🌍

The `Environment` API provides a way to get property values.

```java
@Autowired
private Environment env;

public String getPropertyName() {
    return env.getProperty("property.name");
}
```

### @ConfigurationProperties 🛠️

`@ConfigurationProperties` allows you to map your property values to POJOs.

```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "property")
public class PropertyConfig {
    private String name;
    // getters and setters...
}
```

## Comparison Table 📊

| Method                | Type Safety | Validation | Binding | Meta-Data Support |
|-----------------------|-------------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| `@Value`              | ❌          | ❌         | ❌     | ❌               |
| `Environment`         | ❌          | ❌         | ❌     | ❌               |
| `@ConfigurationProperties` | ✅      | ✅         | ✅     | ✅               |

As you can see, `@ConfigurationProperties` is the clear winner here! 🏆 It provides type safety, validation, binding, and meta-data support. However, the other methods can still be useful in certain situations.

Remember, the best tool for the job depends on your specific use case. So choose wisely! 🧠

Happy coding! 🚀
